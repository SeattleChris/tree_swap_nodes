# tree_swap_nodes

A binary tree is a tree which is characterized by the following properties:

* It can be empty (null).
* It contains a root node only.
* It contains a root node with a left subtree, a right subtree, or both.
* All subtrees are also binary trees.

In-order traversal is performed as

* Traverse the left subtree.
* Visit (record, or 'do work' at) root.
* Traverse the right subtree.

For this in-order traversal, travel to the left child of the root node and keep exploring the left subtree until you reach a leaf. When you reach a leaf, back up to its parent, check for and travel to a right child if there is one. If there is not a child, you've explored its left and right subtrees fully. If there is a right child, traverse its left subtree then its right in the same manner. Keep doing this until you have traversed the entire tree. You will only 'do work' (store the values) at a node that you visit after you have traversed it's left sub-tree, but before you traverse it's right sub-tree.

Swapping: Swapping subtrees of a node means that if initially node has left subtree L and right subtree R, then after swapping, the left subtree will be R and the right subtree, L.

For example, in the following tree, we swap children of node 1.

                                Depth
    1               1            [1]
   / \             / \
  2   3     ->    3   2          [2]
   \   \           \   \
    4   5           5   4        [3]
In-order traversal of left tree is `2 4 1 3 5` and of right tree is `3 5 1 2 4`.

Swap operation:

We define depth of a node as follows:

The root node is at depth 1.
If the depth of the parent node is d, then the depth of current node will be d+1.
Given a tree and an integer, k, in one operation, we need to swap the subtrees of all the nodes at each depth h, where h âˆˆ [k, 2k, 3k,...]. In other words, if h is a multiple of k, swap the left and right subtrees of that level.

You are given a tree of n nodes where nodes are indexed from [1..n] and it is rooted at 1. You have to perform t swap operations on it, and after each swap operation print the in-order traversal of the current state of the tree.

## Function Description

Complete the swapNodes function which has the following parameters:

* indexes: an array of integers representing index values of each , beginning with , the first element, as the root.
* queries: an array of integers, each representing a  value.

Returns:

* a two-dimensional array where each element is an array of integers representing the node indices of an in-order traversal after a swap operation.

## Input Format

The first line contains n, number of nodes in the tree.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers, a b, where a is the index of left child, and b is the index of right child of ith node.

Note: -1 is used to represent a null node.

The next line contains an integer, t, the size of .
Each of the next t lines contains an integer , each being a value .

## Output Format

For each k, perform the swap operation and store the indices of your in-order traversal to your result array. After all swap operations have been performed, return your result array for printing.

## Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 1024
* 1 <= t <= 100
* 1 <= k <= n
* Either a = -1 or 2 <= a <= n
* Either b = -1 or 2 <= b <= n
* The index of a non-null child will always be greater than that of its parent.
